# Data-Engineering
This repository was created with the intention to store files, notebooks, scripts and documents created or generated along Alura Data Engineering Tech Guide formation. The ideia of this repo is to be helpful and useful when the need of review / remember something appears.

This repo also means to be a way of register all the progress that has being done by myself while improving programming skills.

If you have any ideas or sugestions, feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Lucas.
